  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Massachusetts_Cannabis_Expungement
continue button field: Mass_Canna_Expungement_Petition_intro
question: |
  Massachusetts Cannabis Expungement
subquestion: |
  Whether you have been convicted or not, a record might exist that could come up in background checks or other criminal history searches.  Expunging your record will permanently destroy the file a court holds.  
  
  The first part of this application will take you through a questionnaire to determine if you are eligible to expunge your misdemeanor or felony cannabis charge.  The second part will help you fill out the form to send to the court. 
  
  Not all records are able to be expunged. Some violent offenses or various other types will disqualify you for expungement.  Multiple charges from one offense are considered one offense.  
  
  This is not legal advice. If you have multiple charges from one incident, it is considered one charge. Misdemeanors and Felonys are able to be expunged but the time requirement is 7 years.
